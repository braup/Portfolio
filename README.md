This project makes use of ***descriptive analysis*** with a waffle chart to  reflect tie scoring from 2018 to 2020.
* **Excel:** Used to pull,clean data, and create visuals
* With this project I wanted to highlight the ties that have changed scoring from 2018 to 2020.

This project makes use of LFD Scoring coupled with ***inferentail analysis*** in order to find a solution due to an occuring issue.
* **Issue:** LFD scoring was outside of parameters
* **Options:** Keep LFD scoring as is even though it is not accurate or find parameters that will align to scoring to be more accurate
* **Solution:** Changed parameters to better score ties to be more accurate
