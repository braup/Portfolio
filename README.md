# Project 1: Tie Grade Repeatabilty

For this project I built a waffle chart to highlight the different areas of ties from 2018 to 2020. With this I wanted to identify if ties stayed the same or got worse over the course of 3 years. 
* **Excel:** Used to pull, clean data, and create visuals

# Project 2: LFD Scoring

This project makes use of LFD Scoring *(LFD stands for localized flaw finding).* With this we had an issue where the LFD Scoring was outside of it's parameters. I had to create an algorithm to update these parameters to match the LFD scoring to the tie as closely as possible. 
* **Issue:** LFD scoring was outside of parameters
* **Options:** Keep LFD scoring as is even though it is not accurate or find parameters that will align to scoring to be more accurate
* **Solution:** Changed parameters to a better score that identifed with for ties to be more accurate
